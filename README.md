## Overview

In this tutorial, you create a serverless API that creates, reads, updates, and deletes items from a DynamoDB table. DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

## Getting Started

You can [create](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_repo_create) a new repo using this template via the `gh` cli:

``` bash
# gh repo create [<name>] [flags]
gh repo create russomi-labs/my-repo \
    --template russomi-labs/template
```

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

``` bash
brew install gh
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Usage

Add notes about how to use the system.
