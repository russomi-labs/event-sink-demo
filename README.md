## Overview

> In computing, a sink, event sink or data sink is a class or function designed to receive incoming events from another object or function. This is commonly implemented in C++ as callbacks. Other object-oriented languages, such as Java and C#, have built-in support for sinks by allowing events to be fired to delegate functions.

## Demo Apps

- [http-dynamo-tutorial](http-dynamo-tutorial/README.md) - In this tutorial
  you create a serverless API that creates, reads, updates, and deletes items
  from a DynamoDB table. DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that
  provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.

- [sam-web-app](sam-web-app/README.md) - This project contains source code and
  supporting files for a serverless application that you can deploy with the AWS
  Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) command line interface (CLI).
